    <h1>Who is Hodeem?</h1>
        
        <p>I'm a mechanical engineer, and up until 2020 a fresh pair of Hanes boxers was the only soft-wear I cared about.</p>
        <p>However, mobile and web development now sets me on fire and I'm excited to see what the future holds in this field.</p>
        
        <p>So, if your company designs impactful products or services, I'd love to be a part of the team.</p> 
        
        <p>Besides work, I started a non-profit because I want to create a reading culture in my home country of Jamaica (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/readjamaica/" target="_blank">ReadJamaica</a>) </p>
        <p>Finally, I like to spend my down-time reading books, watching series, and learning new things.</p>

        <h1>What do I do?</h1>

        <div>
            <p>I build dynamic websites using the front-end trinity of HTML, CSS and Javascript along with a variety of related libraries, frameworks and back-end building blocks.</p>
            <p>With each project I challenge myself to not only solve a worthwhile problem or create value for the user, but to also learn a new library, framework or a better way of doing things.</p>
            <p>Below is the first project that I've accomplished to date. You should revisit periodically for updates:</p>

        <div class="modal-body">
    
        <p>I wanted to analyze farmgate data provided by a local agricultural institution, but the experience was very frustrating (<a href="http://reports.ja-mis.com/query_price_data_archiverpt.php" target="_blank">I want to be frustrated too</a>).</p> 
        <p>As it turns out, I wasn't the only person who felt this way.</p>
        <p>So, for my first project I decided to build a website that would make it easier to analyze and visualize the data.</p>

            showed that I still have room for improvement, but it's comforting to know that I accomplished my goal of designing a better user experience.</p>

        <h1>Why do I read?</h1>

        <p>I try to read books that expand my worldview, deepen my understanding of a topic or encourage me to think differently.</p> 
        <p>My favourite non-technical books overwhelmingly fall in the social sciences (psychology, history etc.).</p>
        <p>If you think we have similar tastes in books, I'd be glad to hear your book recommendations.</p>
        <p>Below are some of the books I've read (or re-read) this year which ticked one of the three aims indicated above.</p>
